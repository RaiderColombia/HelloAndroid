# HelloAndroid
This is my first Android App!. Finally I can do it :)

You can find the tutorial I followed in [Building Your First App](https://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html).

When you enter a message in the app, it prints in the screen the following message:
>Hello **<your_message>** to the World!

# Example
**Input**: Jhon Fredy

**Output**: Hello **Jhon Fredy** to the World!
